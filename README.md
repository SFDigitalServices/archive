# SFgov web archive

This repo contains code and documentation for the City & County of San Francisco's web archiving efforts.

## Goals
- Ease the migration of City sites to [sf.gov]
- Snapshot and save legacy sites for future reference
- Ensure that old URLs do not break (404 or otherwise)
- Publicly document the status of the City's archiving efforts

## ADRs
We use [**A**rchitectural **D**ecision **R**ecords][adr] to propose, evaluate, and make decisions about technical architecture. Our ADRs are written as [Markdown] in the [adr directory](./adr).
