# VirtualHosts are confusing! Here's the deal: httpd will apply the rules from
# the first VirtualHost directive that matches:
#
# If the hostname and port match the pattern in `<VirtualHost pattern>`, _and_
# If the hostname (HTTP Host header) matches the ServerName or any ServerAlias
#
# For our use case, it's better to just do all of the host matching "logic" with
# ServerName and ServerAlias directives. Our only rule is that the default
# VirtualHost needs to come first, because:
#
# > If no matching ServerName or ServerAlias is found in the set of virtual
# > hosts containing the most specific matching IP address and port combination,
# > then the first listed virtual host that matches that will be used.
#
# See: <https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/vhosts/name-based.html#defaultvhost>
#
# Note: "80" here is the port, per `Listen 80` in httpd's default config.
